Not cleaning like a normal\r\n               person, but like an obsessive/compulsive person. Scrubbing spots\r\n               that are already clean, vacuuming the same area of rug over\r\n               and over, etc. Suddenly, an object lodges itself in the snout\r\n               of the vacuum cleaner, making a loud noise. Shutting the machine\r\n               off, Ann turns it over and sees that Cynthia's diamond stud\r\n               earring has gotten hooked in the take-up roller.\r\n          \r\n               Ann stares at Cynthia's earring for a long moment.\r\n          \r\n               CUT TO:\r\n          \r\n               Cynthia picking up her jacket from beside the bed after having\r\n               sex with John. The earring slips out of the pocket and bounces\r\n               under the edge of the bed.\r\n          \r\n               CUT BACK TO:\r\n          \r\n               Ann as she sets the earring onto the floor and begins to pound\r\n               it with the bottom of a water glass, trying to smash it to\r\n               pieces. She soon realizes the futility of trying to break a\r\n               diamond.\r\n          \r\n               Ann looks down at herself. Suddenly realizing that she is\r\n               dressed in John's clothing, she frantically rips the shirt and\r\n               pants from her body as though the material were burning her\r\n               skin. Popped buttons skid across the floor.\r\n          \r\n               Clothed only in her bra and underwear, Ann sits in the middle\r\n               of the bedroom floor, arms around herself.\r\n          \r\n          43   EXT. JOHN AND ANN MILLANEY'S HOUSE -- DAY\r\n          \r\n               Ann, now in jeans and t-shirt, stumbles to her car. Once inside,\r\n               she jams the key into the ignition and rests her head against\r\n               the steering wheel.\r\n          \r\n          44   EXT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- DAY\r\n          \r\n               Ann lifts her head from the steering wheel and looks up. She\r\n               looks almost surprised to find that she has driven to Graham's.\r\n               Slowly, she gets out of the car.\r\n          \r\n          45   INT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- DAY\r\n          \r\n               Graham sits reading.\r\n          \r\n               There is a weak knock at the door. Graham listens, not sure he\r\n               heard anything. There is a second weak knock.\r\n          \r\n                                   GRAHAM\r\n                         It's open!\r\n          \r\n               Nothing happens. Graham gets up and opens the door himself.\r\n               Ann stands against the wall of the hallway, her head down, her\r\n               breathing deliberate. Concerned, Graham slowly begins to lead\r\n               her inside. Impulsively, she hugs him tightly.\r\n          \r\n               Unaccustomed to physical contact, Graham's hands hang awkwardly\r\n               at his side. Ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and sits\r\n               down. Graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a glass of\r\n               water. He gives it to her and sits in the chair opposite. Ann\r\n               holds the glass in her hand, staring at it.\r\n          \r\n                                   GRAHAM\r\n                         It's bottled, not tap.\r\n          \r\n               A weak smile from Ann.

There s something\r\n                         in my mind...the way my brain\r\n                         works...\r\n                              [frustrated)\r\n                         God, Ann, when you're with another\r\n                         person, and you re...inside\r\n                         them, you're so vulnerable, you're\r\n                         revealing so much...there's no\r\n                         protection. And...somebody could\r\n                         say, or do something to you while\r\n                         you re in this...state\r\n                         of...nakedness.

Their eyes lock. Graham\r\n               slowly moves back toward her.\r\n          \r\n               Ann's hand eases out to him, her eyes still burning into his.\r\n               Graham closes his eyes, accepting Ann's touch.\r\n          \r\n               She caresses him.\r\n          \r\n               Slowly.\r\n          \r\n               Delicately.\r\n          \r\n               She touches his arms, his face, his hair.\r\n          \r\n               Closing her eyes, she takes his hand and puts it against her\r\n               face.\r\n          \r\n               She begins to lie him back on the couch. When he offers light\r\n               resistance, she gently persists.\r\n          \r\n                                   ANN\r\n                         Keep your eyes closed.\r\n          \r\n               Graham lies back, silently obeying.\r\n          \r\n               Ann touches his face.\r\n          \r\n               Gradually, her hand slips to his neck and she begins to \r\n               unbutton his shirt. She watches his face, hoping that he will\r\n               remain calm. He does.\r\n          \r\n               She rubs her hand on his chest.\r\n          \r\n               Once again she brings Graham's hand to her face. She moves his\r\n               hand to her neck and throat, painting her skin with his fingers.\r\n          \r\n               Soon each hand is exploring the other. Fingers search for and\r\n               find hidden areas.\r\n          \r\n               Ann stands.\r\n          \r\n               Their hands remain together, and Graham's eyes remain closed.\r\n               Ann moves onto the couch with Graham.\r\n          \r\n               She gently lowers herself into a sitting position on his waist.\r\n          \r\n               She slowly moves both of her hands onto Graham's chest. They\r\n               move forward and back, like a lazy tide.\r\n          \r\n               She looks at Graham. His face is tranquil.\r\n          \r\n               Ann quietly begins to move her face toward his.\r\n          \r\n               Soon she is hovering inches above him, her long hair touching\r\n               his features.\r\n          \r\n               She lowers her lips to his forehead and kisses him. She waits\r\n               for a negative reaction. Getting none, she moves lower and \r\n               kisses his eyes. Still receiving no discouragement, she moves\r\n               to his nose.\r\n          \r\n               A subtle movement from Graham. Ann waits for a moment.\r\n          \r\n               She then moves to his lips, her luxuriant tresses enveloping\r\n               his face.\r\n          \r\n               She kisses him lightly.\r\n          \r\n               She kisses him again.\r\n          \r\n               Graham tilts his head back and she softly kisses his neck.\r\n          \r\n               Graham's hands make their way up Ann's back until they have\r\n               reached her neck. He slowly pulls his face to hers.\r\n          \r\n               He kisses her.\r\n          \r\n               Graham is flooded with warmth and excitement.\r\n          \r\n               He caresses her, intoxicating himself with physical contact.\r\n          \r\n               The kisses become more meaningful, and the touching becomes\r\n               more passionate.\r\n          \r\n               For a moment, Graham seems about to evaporate in a state of\r\n               ecstasy, his eyes filled with relief and happiness.\r\n          \r\n               But his gaze happens to fall on the video camera, which\r\n               continues to record.\r\n          \r\n               Graham seizes up and abruptly backs away from Ann's embrace.\r\n               Reality slowly envelopes him.\r\n          \r\n                                   ANN\r\n                         Graham...\r\n          \r\n                                   GRAHAM\r\n                         I'm okay. It's okay.\r\n          \r\n               Ann reaches for his hand. He allows her to take it.\r\n          \r\n                                   GRAHAM\r\n                              (almost dazed)\r\n                         It's okay.\r\n          \r\n               Graham looks at Ann for a long moment. She sees the acceptance\r\n               and gratitude in his eyes. She smiles lightly.\r\n          \r\n               Graham moves forward and shuts off the camera.\r\n          \r\n               CUT BACK TO:\r\n          \r\n               John watching the tape. There is video snow on the monitor now.\r\n               The tape timer reads 46:02. John gets up slowly, ejects the tape\r\n               from the player, and heads for the door.\r\n          \r\n               Graham, hearing the footsteps approach, backs away from the\r\n               inlet. His eye is swollen, and he holds one of his hands in\r\n               a curious position.\r\n          \r\n               John opens the door. He looks at Graham for a moment before\r\n               reaching into his pocket for Graham's keys. He dangles them\r\n               in his hand as he stands over Graham.\r\n                         \r\n                                   JOHN\r\n                         I never told you this, because\r\n                         I thought it would crush you, but\r\n                         now I could give a shit.\r\n                              (pause)\r\n                         I fucked Elizabeth.

She was\r\n                         good in bed and she could keep\r\n                         a secret. And that's about all\r\n                         I can say about her.\r\n          \r\n               John drops Graham's keys to the floor and leaves. Graham stands,\r\n               fighting back tears, and walks into his apartment.\r\n          \r\n               He pulls Ann's tape from the videotape player.\r\n          \r\n               He reaches inside the cassette cartridge and pulls the videotape\r\n               itself out, ruining it forever. He does the same to every other\r\n               tape in both the boxes. Calmly. Deliberately. Methodically.\r\n          \r\n               He walks over to the camera/recorder, trailing a mound of\r\n               videotape behind him. He breaks the lens off the camera body,\r\n               and smashes the inner workings against the edge of the table.\r\n               He then drops the damaged unit into the pile of destroyed tape,\r\n               where it disappears.\r\n          \r\n               CUT TO BLACK:\r\n          \r\n               THEN CUT TO:\r\n          \r\n          52   INT.

Bookshelves, plants, etc. There are periodicals on\r\n               the table where the video gear used to be. There are no\r\n               cigarettes.\r\n          \r\n               There is a knock at Graham's door, which now has a deadbolt\r\n               lock.\r\n          \r\n                                   GRAHAM\r\n                         Who is it?\r\n          \r\n               A knock again.

Sensing him behind her, her\r\n               breathing becomes deep.\r\n          \r\n               Graham slowly enfolds her in his arms, his face against her\r\n               hair.\r\n          \r\n               She closes her eyes as their fingers entwine.\r\n          \r\n               CUT TO BLACK\r\n          \r\n               THE END\r\n          \r\n          \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nSex, Lies and Videotape\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Steven Soderbergh\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\r\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex \r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Submit \r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Link to IMSDb \r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Disclaimer \r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Privacy policy \r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Contact\n\n\n\n"
