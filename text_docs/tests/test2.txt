I hope this side project works out.
I feel like that would be pretty cool.
Markov chains are interesting.
Physics is very interesting to know about, but it can be a pain to learn.
Deep down, I am grateful of pursuing physics even though I know it would have been easier just being a Computer Science student.
UNC is a great school.
The academics are pretty solid, and the culture is phenomenal.
I hope I didn't mistype anything.
Eh, whatever.
